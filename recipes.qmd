## Baked Potato Cubes

Preheat oven.

Before you boil potato cubes, add baking soda to the water. The cubes will get very slimy (the starch is extracted to the surface). Before they are fully cooked through, get the cubes out of the water and arrange them on a baking tray.

Season the cubes. Bake the cubes. Cubes will be crispy. So much. Enjoy. Yum.
